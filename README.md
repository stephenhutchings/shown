Javascript.

---

`shown` generates simple HTML and SVG charts. The library works with static-site
generators (SSG), or in server-side rendering (SSR) contexts to create
self-contained, embeddable chart documents. It aims to fill a gap between
unresponsive images and complex data visualization tools.

The library offers a high-level API to generate charts, providing good results
with minimal configuration. When more flexibility is required, expressive data
mapping allows for fine-grained control. Plug and play data from different
sources, mapping values as you need them.

Charts adapt to different screen-sizes without any need for client-side
JavaScript. Charts will expand and contract to fill their containers without
affecting font size, so text remains legible across viewports.

Charts render without client-side JavaScript, reducing bundle sizes and
improving performance by avoiding expensive recalculations when a container
resizes.
